This is the FULL LIST of usable mons you can pull from to challenge the gyms.  Please note that this list is still in the works, and so new additions may be made at later times.

Please note the implementation of the T RULE:

**T Rule**: You are permitted to have ONE non-TPP mon on your team, so long as you have no UBERS on your team, and your non-TPP mon is NOT an UBER.

Additional rules to take note of:

* Only one UBER and one MEGA on your team normally (can use T Rule if no Ubers)

* You can freely change movesets between battles, but be mindful of some special gym rules.

Notes: When making your team, you should use this list as a check to make sure your team is legal.  It is not advisable to look through the list first and then pick a team based on what 6 mons are the best, but we're not stopping you from doing that.

AND ON TO THE LIST:

* **List #1: No Brainers**

*These mons are not even debatable - they are for sure, and will always be, TPP Mons that can be used.*

* **List#3: Controversial**

*These mons are TPP related mons, but their effect on the TPP lore isn't as powerful as some others might be, and as such their presence may be debated by some.  But, for now, they are acceptable and you can use them on your team.  Be aware though - they can be removed from this list if enough opposition becomes prevalent.  If anything on this list becomes removed, new teams cannot register with them (but old registered teams can still keep them).  New mons can still be added to this list, but this is all that's here for now.*
